What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What worked:

-It was a wise decision to start early, and spread out the time to do the work. This allowed me to reduce the anxiety that this type of assignments usually provoque in me. 

-Coding with other people is life changing. As expected, I got stuck several times, but having others look at my code and give me feedback helped me to find solutions more easily. 

What didn't:

-I couldn't find the solution to a problem for while because I was wrong about what the problem was. I thought that my refurbish function was not working because the inventory was not printing the updated version with the new price and OS. A friend told me to use print statement to debug, and I found out that there was nothing wrong with the refurbish function. I just had to update the inventory variable.

what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future:

-Start Simple Small and Slow

-Try to work a couple of hours each day, starting from the day you received the assignment. This will avoid the need to work all night before the due date.

-CODE WITH OTHER PEOPLE!
